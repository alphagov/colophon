# GOV.UK Colophon

Here we're collecting a list of the components, tools and services that we've used at the Government Digital Service to build [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/).

Included here are snapshots of our stack at key releases, such as the [alpha](https://github.com/alphagov/colophon/blob/master/alpha.md) and [beta](https://github.com/alphagov/colophon/blob/master/beta.md), and an evolving list of components for the [live site](https://github.com/alphagov/colophon/blob/master/live.md).
